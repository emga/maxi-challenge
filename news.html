    <h2>History of Popular Music</h2>
      <h5>BY BRODY VERCHER ON DECEMBER 15, 2014</h5>
        <p>“The most significant feature of the emergent popular music industry of the late 18th and early 19th
           centuries was the extent of its focus on the commodity form of sheet music” The availability of
           inexpensive, widely available sheet music versions of popular songs and instrumental music pieces
           made it possible for music to be disseminated to a wide audience of amateur music-makers, who
           could play and sing popular music at home. In addition to the influence of sheet music, another
           factor was the increasing availability during the late 18th and early 19th century of public popular
           music performances in “pleasure gardens and dance halls, popular theatres and concert rooms”. The
           early popular music performers worked hand-in-hand with the sheet music industry to promote
           popular sheet music. One of the early popular music performers to attain widespread popularity was
           a Swedish opera singer Jenny Lind, who toured the US in the mid-19th century. During the 19th
           century, more people began getting involved in music by participating in amateur choirs or joining
           brass bands.</p>

    <h2>In Every Work of Genius We Recognize Our
      Own Rejected Thzoughts</h2>
      <h5>BY BRODY VERCHER ON DECEMBER 12, 2014</h5>
        <p>I read the other day some verses written by an eminent painter which were original and not
           conventional. The soul always hears an admonition in such lines, let the subject be what it may.
           The sentiment they instil is of more value than any thought they may contain. To believe your
           own thought, to believe that what is true for you in your private heart is true for all men,—that
           is genius. Speak your latent conviction, and it shall be the universal sense; for the inmost in due
           time becomes the outmost, and our first thought is rendered back to us by the trumpets of the
           Last Judgment. Familiar as the voice of the mind is to each, the highest merit we ascribe to
           Moses, Plato and Milton is that they set at naught books and traditions, and spoke not what
           men, but what they thought. A man should learn to detect and watch that gleam of light which
           flashes across his mind from within, more than the lustre of the firmament of bards and sages.
           Yet he dismisses without notice his thought, because it is his. In every work of genius we
           recognize our own rejected thoughts; they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty.
           Great works of art have no more affecting lesson for us than this. They teach us to abide by our
           spontaneous impression with good- humored inflexibility then most when the whole cry of
           voices is on the other side. Else to-morrow a stranger will say with masterly good sense
           precisely what we have thought and felt all the time, and we shall be forced to take with shame
           our own opinion from another.</p>
